Problem 1:

We have used the following datasets:
1. deliveries.csv

# Task 2 

*Final Team Prediction* 

We have used the following datasets:

2. matches.csv


To generate the final teams, we have created the 3 models 
toss_decision.ipynb, run_prediction_innings_1.ipynb, run_prediction_innings_2.ipynb
for the 4 teams that have qualified into semi-finals and then based on the runs scored decided the final two teams 

Team 11 for the two final teams
